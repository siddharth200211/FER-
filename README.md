Facial Expression Recognition using OpenCV, Python, scikit-learn, and MediaPipe.

This repository contains the code and resources for Facial Expression Recognition (FER) using OpenCV, Python, scikit-learn, and MediaPipe.
The project aims to detect and analyze facial expressions in real-time video streams.

Features:

OpenCV Integration: Utilizes OpenCV for real-time video processing and facial feature extraction.

Python: Written in Python for its ease of use and versatility.

Scikit-learn: Employs scikit-learn for training machine learning models for facial expression recognition.

MediaPipe: Integrates MediaPipe for face detection and landmark localization.

Custom Dataset: Includes a custom dataset meticulously curated to encompass diverse facial expressions, enhancing model accuracy and robustness.

Files Included:

prepare_data.py: Python script for preparing and preprocessing the custom dataset.

train_model.py: Python script for training machine learning models using scikit-learn.

test_model.py: Python script for testing the trained models on new data.

utils.py: Python module containing utility functions used across the project.
